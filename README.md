## Notes

#### Solution code cells

You can always start working by removing this line of comment: 

```
# ADD YOUR CODE HERE
```

We are checking your solutions semi-automatically. Please use the suggested
variable names when writing your code. 

#### Non-editable code cells

Some of the code-cells are ‘non-editable’ which means that you are supposed to
run them, but you are not able to edit them. These non-editable code cells
should help you test your code while you proceed. 

#### Immediate feedback

Whenever you push and submit your work, an automated process will check your
submission and tell you how many points you have achieved, so far. The feedback
includes a list of possible improvements (unless there is nothing to improve on
anymore, of course ;) ).

You can find this feedback in the [‘Pull Request’](../pull/1) that has been
automatically opened when you [accepted the GitHub classroom 
assignment](#).
